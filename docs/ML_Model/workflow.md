# ML models for fast sim

## ML Models

We are invovled in development of the ML models for fast shower simulation, and so far we could offer the following models:

1. VAE developed within the context of [Geant4 extended example Par04](https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Examples/extended/Par04.html#par04). Details of that model are presented [here]](VAE_training.md)
2. CaloDiT - transformer-based diffusion model. More details of that model can be found [here](CaloDiT_training.md).

While all our models can be trained from scratch, our goal is to provide ready pre-trained models that allow for quicker and less data-demanding tuning. It is possible thanks to the general and highly granular structure of the shower dataset, which we call a scoring mesh of energy deposited within each particle shower. Tutorial on how to use both approaches is [available here](../G4FastSim/Step00_overview.md).

## Workflow description

The figure below represents different components of the workflow integrating the use of the ML models within the production simulation. Most of the details presented here refer to our initial work, including the application of the VAE model, however the workflow does not change when we change the developed models.

- The preprocessing module allows us to prepare (data cleaning, scaling,...) the full simulated data generated using Geant4, creating a universal shower representation. It also encodes all condition information (to build conditional generative models): the identifier of the calorimeter, energy of the particle initiating the shower, and the angle at which particles enter the detector. This could be extended for instance with the particle type, or with the initial particle position. 
- The preprocessed data is then used by the generative model for training. 
- In order to search for the best set of hyperparameters of the model, the optimization module (at training step) is used.
- After training, optimization and validation steps, the model is converted into a format such as JSON or ONNX that can be used for inference in C++ (within Geant4). 
- Optimization (at inference) techniques such as quantization and graph optimizations are used to further reduce the memory footprint of the model at the inference time.

## Dataset description

### Calorimeter setup and mesh definition

In our studies, we use simplified and realistic calorimeter geometries. The simplified calorimeter is a setup of concentric cylinders with interchanging layers of materials (active and passive), as defined in the [Geant4 extended example Par04](https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/-/tree/master/examples/extended/parameterisations/Par04?ref_type=heads). In the figure below they are represented in red for passive absorber and in blue for active material. Energy deposits are scored in the detector using a cylindrical readout structure (black), centered around the particle momentum, as shown in the figure below. Dimensions of the readout structure are configured w.r.t what the study needs in terms of granularity. Those readout structures would have the same dimensions for each studied geometry to facilitate creation of the universal shower representation. To ensure the same containment of particles, it implies that the size of the readout cells will be different for each geometry.

For the current studies we used three different geometry layouts generated with Geant4 Par04 example (the **idealized geometries** due to their simplicity). The first one uses layers of silicon and tungsten (**SiW**). Another geometry is built up with materials of scintillator and lead (**SciPb**). A third detector is a homogeneous one, with single block of lead tungstate (**PbWO4**). 

For realistic (feasible to construct) geometries, we use detectors studied in the context of the electron positron collider experiment on the [Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/future-circular-collider) and we start with the design based on the [CLIC detector](https://clicdp.web.cern.ch/). This geometry comprises of flat silicon sensors, accompanied with number of materials, most notably tungsten, but also readout and electrode plates, as well as spacing in between layers. In the transverse cross section of the detector flat sensors are placed on octagon.

As mentioned in the workflow description, particle showers are simulated with Geant4 (Geant4-app refers to a Geant4 application for particle simulation, it is different for idealized geometries, and different one for FCC-ee detectors). In order to register deposited energy at the granularity level independent on the detector readout, we implemented a **scoring mesh** which is not connected to the physical detector segmentation. It is represented by the black cylinder in the figure above. The advantage of using this mesh is the possibility of defining a high granularity segmentation independently of the detector readout segmentation, of the angle at which a particle enters the detector, and it can be identical (dimension-wise) for all studied geometries. The energy is scored in a mesh as follows: whenever a particle enters the volume of the calorimeter, its momentum direction is used to define the position and the orientation of the cylindrical readout structure, which is centered around the particle momentum. The size of the mesh determines the granularity of the produced showers, and size of each cell differs for each of the studied geometries. However, the number of mesh cells should remain identical, as it is directly linked to the generative model design. The size and number of cells is chosen to ensure high containment of particles. The cylindrical readout is depicted in the figure below.

Dimensions of the physical detector layers and the mesh readout for the studied geometries are summarized in table below. The number of mesh cells has been optimized to contain on average at least 95 % of energy deposited by 1 TeV electrons.

| Detector  |  Thickness of the active material (mm) |  Thickness of the passive material (mm) |  Number of physical layers |  R | P | N |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SiW | 0.3 | 1.4| 90| 18 | 50| 45 |
| SciPb | 1.2| 1.4| 45| 18 | 50| 45 |  
| PBW04| 200.25|  | 1| 18| 50| 45 |   
| SiW FCC-ee| 0.5 |1.8 |40 |18| 50| 45|  

In some early studies, different granularities were explored such a segmentation of (24,24,24) or (50,48,120) in (r,&phi;,z).

### Particles, energies and angles

For our studies we use different particles, energies and incident angles. The full simulation samples are showers of electrons or photons generated with an energy range from 1 GeV to 1 TeV (in powers of 2) and angles from 50&deg;to 90&deg; (in a step of 10&deg;). Entrance angle of 90&deg; means perpendicular to the z-axis. Ten thousand particle showers are simulated for each primary particle energy and angle. 


### Data preprocessing 

The output of the full simulation is a [ROOT](https://root.cern) file per energy and angle. The output file contains ntuple `events` with per-event information (event=single incident particle) as well as control histograms. Ntuple contains incident particle energy, simulation time, and vectors of energy deposits (vectors of same length, with: deposited energy, r,&phi; and z).

In order to be able to train the models, the ROOT files are converted into a ML-friendly format [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/). Dataset of showers are stored as 3D array representing the energy deposition of cells in (r,&phi;,z). For each incident particle energy a separate file is created. The preprocessing component allows us as well to define encoding values of conditional information such as the identifier of the detector (one-hot encoding, e.g. [0 0 1] for SiW, [0 1 0] for SciPb), the energy and angle of the incoming particle.


## Validation

The validation is used to assess the performance of the model. Figures of merit are based on shower observables, which describe shower characteristics. This validation compares distributions of shower observables of full and fast simulation. There are two validation levels: the standalone validation, performed in python within or after the training, is used as a metric to evaluate the generation power of the model. The validation at the inference time, performed within Geant4 in C++ is used to ensure that the fast simulation is accurate after mapping the inferred energies to positions in the calorimeter.

Among shower observables, there are the so-called shower profiles. The **longitudinal profile** represents the energy deposited by a shower as a function of the depth of the calorimeter (z-axis). The **lateral (transverse) profile** represents the energy density distribution as function of the radial coordinate.

Individual profiles may vary significantly, due to the nature of the stochastic process of shower development. The average shower profiles (over many showers) can be seen in the figure below which presents longitudinal profiles of electromagnetic showers of different energies of electrons for 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10 000 GeV.

Moments of the longitudinal and transverse profiles are also used to validate the fast simulation model. In addition to shower profiles, total energy distribution (sum of all deposits) is checked, and the distribution of cell energy deposits. Other relevant metrics of validation are the simulation time and the memory footprint of the model. The simulation time refers to the time needed for the full/fast simulation approach to run a single particle simulation in Geant4. The memory footprint is used to measure the amount of memory needed by the fast simulation model to run the inference.
